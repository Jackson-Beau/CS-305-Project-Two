- The most challanging part of the project was generating the certificates and the most useful was learning how to do dependancy checks 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
-Ive increased levels of secuirty by using a chiper that is secure SHA 256 and assuring the communications were all secure.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
-How i made sure the code and software appliction were functional and secure by using functional testing praces. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
-Maven Depedency checker was most useful 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
-I will display my understanding for finding vulnerabilities within a projects code .
